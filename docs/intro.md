# What is Camino?

## Introduction

[Camino](https://chain4travel.com) is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Camino is built for the scale of the global touristic market, with near-instant transaction finality. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Camino as Solidity works out-of-the-box.

## CAM

CAM is the native token of Camino. It’s a hard-capped, scarce asset that is used to pay for fees, secure the platform through staking, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple subnets created on Camino. `1 nCAM` is equal to `0.000000001 CAM`.

## Camino Consensus Protocol

Protocols in the Camino family operate through repeated sub-sampled voting.

In the common case when a transaction has no conflicts, finalization happens very quickly. When conflicts exist, honest validators quickly cluster around conflicting transactions, entering a positive feedback loop until all correct validators prefer that transaction. This leads to the acceptance of non-conflicting transactions and the rejection of conflicting transactions.

Learn more technical components of the Camino consensus protocol by reading the [Avalanche whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08936.pdf).

## Key Features

### Speed

Uses a consensus protocol, developed by a team of Cornell computer scientists, and is able to permanently confirm transactions in under 1 second.

### Scalability

Capable of 4,500 transactions per second–an order of magnitude greater than existing blockchains.

### Security

Ensures stronger security guarantees well-above the 51% standard of other networks.

### Flexibility

Easily create custom blockchains and decentralized apps that contain almost any arbitrary logic.

### Sustainability

Uses energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus algorithm rather than proof-of-work.

### Smart Contract Support

Supports the creation of Solidity smart contracts and your favorite Ethereum tools like Remix, Metamask, Truffle, and more.

### Private and Public Blockchains

Create your own public or private blockchains.

### Designed for the touristic market

Native support for easily creating digital smart assets with complex, custom rulesets.
